# COVID-19-cough-detection
an IOT based application to detect covid-19 symptoms, though its not very efficient----
A device to help fighting with Coronavirus. It is a cough detection system, which can distinguish between noise and cough sound and can help finding Corona suspect. It will use machine learning techniques for that

going to build a Cough Detection system using Arduino 33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse Studio. It can differentiate between normal background noise and coughing in real-time audio. We used Edge Impulse Studio to train a dataset of coughing and background noise samples and build a highly optimized TInyML model, that can detect a Cough sound in real-time.
